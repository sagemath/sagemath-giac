sagemath-giac-0.1.2 (2025-05-06)

  * Build system support for --editable SageMath installations.

sagemath-giac-0.1.1 (2025-02-23)

  * Use the c++11 standard instead of c++17 to build. This fixes
    a build failure on macOS (and is correct anyway).

  * Better support for building against sage in a venv.

sagemath-giac-0.1.0 (2025-02-19)

  * Initial release. With a few tweaks, this is the sage.libs.giac
    module that was shipped with SageMath in the past.

  * The doctests have been rewritten in pure python, so they can
    be run without "sage -t".

  * __init__.py has been split into gb.py (the groebner_basis
    function) and context.py (the local_giacsettings decorator). This
    is more for convenience than principle; __init__.py causes issues
    when doctesting a meson-python project, and Sage is capable of
    abstracting away the name changes.

  * A dependency on gmpy2 has replaced sage.libs.gmp.
